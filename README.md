## About

This repository serves as a collection of my Python projects and the implementations of concepts I've learned during my programming journey. Feel free to explore the code and documentation.

## Python Projects

Here are some of the Python projects included in this repository:

1. **BMI Calculator:**
   - Basically, it is Body Mass Indexed calculating tool. And it provide your BMI value and also the category you are lie in.
   - Basic and Advanced level code is provided.
   

2. **Calculator:**
   - Its is project, which is useful for real world calculations. it can take n numbers of input and can provide you the calculated value within seconds.


3. **Weather App:**
   - This is a Weather app, helps in getting the weather information, by using the API that connects the database of a server. And then provide us the weather condition of    required city. In this app, i have used a Python 'Request' module to GET the required information from the Server.
  
4. **KBC-Game:**
   - A programmer always has two skills - firstly, they are fun-loving, and the other is that they never back off from experimenting. As a proficient programmer, I utilized both of these skills by developing this KBC Game. Here, you can play the KBC game and even win a prize. This is a creative approach developed by me; I believe you're going to love this project. Don't forget to give it a star, and meaningful contributions are appreciated.


## Learning Implementations

In addition to the projects, this repository also contains implementations related to my learning in areas such as:

- **Recurssion:**
  - Recursion is a programming and mathematical concept where a function calls itself in its own definition. In the context of programming, a recursive function is a function that solves a problem by solving smaller instances of the same problem. This process continues until a base case is reached, at which point the function returns a result without making further recursive calls.
